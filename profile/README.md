## What is alova?

alova (pronounced /əˈləʊva/) is an workflow-streamlined next-generation request tool that helps you extremely streamline API integration workflow

## Is there any difference?

Unlike other request libraries, alova aims to make requests very simple and maintain more efficient data interaction.

We consider both developers and App users. For developers, alova provides them with the ultimate user experience, and for application users, they can enjoy the smooth experience brought by alova's high-performance data interaction.

In addition, let's take a look at the specific features:

- The API design similar to Axios makes the learning cost of users lower;
- High-performance client and server request strategies make the application smoother;
- High flexibility, Alova's adapter allows Alova to work with any UI framework in any JS environment, and provides a unified user experience and perfect code migration;
- 2 cache modes and request sharing mechanisms to improve request performance and reduce server pressure;
- High aggregation organization of API code, each API's request parameters, cache behavior, response data conversion, etc. will be gathered in the same code block, which is a great advantage for managing a large number of APIs;
